# Neural Network Quadratic Line Predictor
This program uses a standard multilayer perceptron neural network. The first part of the program is trained to recognize the pattern of a line drawn using a quadratic equatinon. The second part of the program automatically predicts points of the line based on inputs, by making use of the training given to it earlier. The program is designed with object oriented programming, and is very flexible in being able to handle multiple inputs, outputs and hidden layers.
